                        Ioan Niras, 24th June 670
Speech given before the Agionic command ahead of the Battle of Gotthopolis.
Prior to giving said speech, Niras is reputed to have been warned by his
subordinates of the threat to his life posed by leading such a broad
cavalry charge - Niras replied to them,

                          "My dear commanders...
My greatest friend in all the world, the late Exarch Turso, is already
dead. Never had he beaten me in his life - not in feats of strength, duel,
or horsemanship. And yet, he has beaten me to death by over a decade now.
In his last act, he scored over me the greatest victory of them all. I am
sixty years old now. That's way too old for any brave man to still be 
breathing. If I'm risking my life by leading the cataphracts ahead, then
let it be so I may finally catch up and be laid to rest beside my old 
friend. This battle is all but cut out for us to win, so let's go and win.
Afterwards we can worry about which old fool remains standing."
